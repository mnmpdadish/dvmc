# How to run the example:

In the present directory, type:

$ ./run.sh

This will run the 3 command lines:

python3 analytical_mVMC.py
dvmc.out namelist.def output/zqp_opt.dat
python3 compare.py


# Requirements

Have this new mVMC code compiled first. Put it in a directory 
available in the PATH variable (usually ~/bin/.). Name this
executable "dvmc.out".


# Result:

If everything works properly you should obtain the difference
between the exact result (obtained from analytical_mVMC.py)
and the mVMC result. The last line shoule be:

"
