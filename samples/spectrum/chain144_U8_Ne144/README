# How to run the example:

In the present directory, type:

$ ./run_vmc.sh
$ mergeOutput.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_0*   # to average the different iterations in 4 numpy data array.
$ print_spectrum.py                          # to output a matrix of A(k,w) in the files Akw.dat, Akw_e.dat, Akw_h.dat
$ generate_template_gnuplot.py               # to get a pretty template to plot A(k,w) scripts (need to be adjusted)
$ gnuplot plot_singleAkw.gp                  # generate akw_single.pdf
$ gnuplot plot_allAkw.gp                     # generate akw_multiple.pdf

On a cluster, instead of typing the first command,
edit properly the header of "run_vmc.sh" and 
submit for example with commands:

$ ./qsub run_vmc.sh

It is better to avoid to include the postprocessing
in the cluster submission as it can take several minutes
and it is not parallelized.

# Requirements

Have the new mVMC code compiled first. This will generate
the executables "/src/mVMC/vmcdry.out" and "/src/mVMC/vmc.out"
Put these in a directory available in the PATH variable 
(usually ~/bin/.). Name these executables "vmcdry_new.out" and 
"vmc_new.out" respectively.

The files for postprocessing must also be in a directory
available in the PATH environment variable. They are all
located in the subdirectory:
"/tool/dynamicalGreenProcessing/*"

This example also require gnuplot installed to plot Akw.dat.
But Akw.dat coule be plot with any software and script at this point.

Although, some generic parameters might need to be adjusted to obtain a 
good result. For example, the an offset must be applied on the frequency
axis so that the Fermi level (omega = 0) is placed manually between the
electron minimum and hole maximum density of state.  

Gnuplot is the software of choice here because it can embed an image
of the A(k,w), resulting in smaller file, faster to process and easier
to scroll by in a PDF file.



# Result:

If everything works, the figure "akw_multiple.pdf" and "akw_single.pdf"
shown if "expected_output" should be produced in the current directory.
