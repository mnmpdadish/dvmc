This example is a little bit more extreme. It is a 12x12 cluster.
For bigger cluster it is necessary to do two additional things:
1. prepares the input to help find the correct ground state.

here the ground state is provided, in order to simplify things. But
to generate it you can simply type:

init_groundstate.py opt.in
mkdir output
mv zqp_opt.dat output/.

and start from there.

2. check every iteration zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_0**.bin before averaging using.

mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_001.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_002.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_003.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_004.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_005.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_006.bin; dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
...
and so on, in order to check that "int dw A( k*,w)  =  0.99160" or close to 1.0. It is
important to filter (remove) any zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_0**.bin files that does not produce this
sum rule. It will give a much better statistic in the end. This probably need to be 
addressed in the future for better understanding.
